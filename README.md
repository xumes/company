#Company
## A React app 
This app is based on the Company Bootstrap template available at [W3Schools]https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_company.asp

- We are developing components for each page;
- Implementing database connections (starting with Firebase, than migrating to a backend application);
- Image upload using Firebase store;
- Unit test
- More, as time permits;
